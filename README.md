Members: Chin Yi Hong, Theresa Lim Jiyi, Khor Sher Liang.
## Getting Started
### Prerequisite
1. Any JAVA IDE. This program was developed using Eclipse and IntelliJ.
2. Any Python IDE for the graph.
### How to run
1. Please download this project and unzip the folder.
2. Create a Java project.
3. Drag and drop the com folder into that project.
4. To run ACO, ensure that TSP_107.txt can be found in Input package/folder.
5. To run TS and SA, ensure that TSP_107.txt is located in project folder.
6. For your ease of running, 2 TSP_107.txt have been included into proper folder.
### How to generate graph
1. For ACO, run the code and the graph will be produced automatically.
2. For SA or TS, run the code to generate an output.txt file.
3. Open your python IDE and run graphing.py. The graph will be generated from there. You may uncomment line 16 to remove the axis of the graph.
